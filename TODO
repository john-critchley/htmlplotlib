- remove dependancy on iPython so that it can be run outside a jupyter sheet more easily
- enable it to be optionally dependent on the gradients in matplotlib so it can use that
- layout check and improve
- make various things movable
  - gradient bar
  - column heading to below - if you like
  - rotate labels or not
  - specify label fonts
- check performance - is it a bit slow now?
- more & better example usages
- command line usage

Add other things which can be done in HTML rather than using a matplotlib or seaborn image!
