- make various things movable
  - column heading to below - if you like
  - rotate labels or not
  - specify label fonts
- more & better example usages
- command line usage
- as well as taking an array as input, want to be able to have a pandas DataFrame (or Series)

Add other things which can be done in HTML rather than using a matplotlib or seaborn image!
eg bar graphs, pie chart?
